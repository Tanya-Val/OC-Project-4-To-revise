# OC-Project-4-To-revise
With access to the website files, you’re ready to get started. You decide to proceed as follows:

Audit the existing website by identifying relevant SEO and accessibility issues, noting an explanation and a credible reference (documentation, research paper, journal…) for each one. Your audit will include a selection of at least 10 actions to take to improve the website’s accessibility and/or SEO (including size and speed).
Apply your recommendations to the code and submit the full source code of the improved website. The W3C HTML and CSS validator should not reveal any errors. 
Demonstrate that your adjustments have improved the website by providing a before-and-after comparison of the results from Google’s Lighthouse tool, accounting for all action taken to optimize the website.
